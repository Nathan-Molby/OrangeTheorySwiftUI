# The Goal
The goal of this project is to recreate most of the features of the Orange Theory Tablet in order to understand some new-to-me Swift APIS.

## Objectives
- Use [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) to create beautiful and organic maps
- Use [Measurements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurement) to store unit-agnostic data and allow the user to change what unit they would like it to be displayed in.
- Completely localize the app using [String Catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) and translate it to at least one other language
- Create a hyper-adaptable layout. Ideally, the display (shown below) will look good on an iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
- Create a generic data layer that would allow this display to support data from any hardware
    - Creating the actual adapter from the hardware layer is out of scope for this project. Instead, I intend to create a few different "mock" providers to showcase what it would look like.
- Support both dark and light mode
- Use environment to propogate data through the app
