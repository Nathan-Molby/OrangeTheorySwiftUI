# The Goal
The goal of this project is to recreate most of the features of the Orange Theory Tablet. 

I intend to use Swift Charts for the graphs and create a few different implementations of the "track" oval (see picture below) to showcase different ways to create it. I'm also planning to allow the layout to be very adaptive to support any sized tablet and (eventually) iPhone.

For the data, I'm planning to create a data protocol and provide a few different mock implementations to simulate workouts. It would theoretically be possible to create an adapter to a real hardware device (like a treadmill), but I don't intend on doing that.
